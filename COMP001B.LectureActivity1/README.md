# My First Website

## Overview
This project is a simple two-page website built with HTML5 and CSS. It demonstrates basic web development skills, including linking multiple pages, using semantic HTML, applying CSS selectors (type, class, and ID), and organizing files in a structured way.

## Files Included
- `index.html` — The home page that includes a "Hello World!" heading, a question about learning CSS, and several paragraphs with my answers.
- `about.html` — The about page that includes a short introduction about me and a photo representing myself.
- `main.css` — The external stylesheet that styles both pages using different types of CSS selectors.

## Features
- Shared navigation bar between pages.
- External stylesheet that applies:
  - Underlined headings (type selector)
  - Bold question paragraph (class selector)
  - Smaller copyright text (ID selector)
  - Bordered and padded image
- Standard HTML5 structure and semantic elements.
- Multiple commits made throughout development to demonstrate version control skills.
