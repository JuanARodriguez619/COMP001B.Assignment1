    <p>My name is Juan Rodriguez, and I’m studying Information Technology. I am studying for cybersecurity purposes and hoping to finish soon with my current year at Lemoore College</p>
    <p>When I am not at school I usually go out with my girlfriend of almost 2 years by this point and play video games a bunch. Occasionally I like playing my electric bass that was given to me but I only use it for fun and not to impress.</p>
    <p>In the meantime I am finding out what I should do with my assiocates degree in order to enssure that I have a good career.
